### \= Operator in Go

1.  **Purpose**: The = operator is used for assignment, where the variable has already been declared.
    
2.  **Usage**: It updates the value of an existing variable.
    
3.  **Scope**: Used within the same block where the variable is declared.
    
4.  goCopy codevar x intx = 10x = 20 // Reassigns the value of x
    
5.  **Explanation**: The variable x is first declared with var and then assigned a value with =.
    

### := Operator in Go

1.  **Purpose**: The := operator is used for short variable declaration and assignment in one step.
    
2.  **Usage**: It declares and initializes a variable in one line.
    
3.  **Scope**: Used within the current block and can only be used inside functions.
    
4.  goCopy codex := 10y := "hello"
    
5.  **Explanation**: The variables x and y are both declared and assigned values in the same statement. This is a shorthand way of declaring and initializing variables without needing the var keyword.
    

### Comparison Summary

*   **Declaration**:
    
    *   \=: Requires variable to be declared previously.
        
    *   :=: Declares and initializes a variable simultaneously.
        
*   **Reassignment**:
    
    *   \=: Used for reassigning values to already declared variables.
        
    *   :=: Cannot be used for reassignment alone; it always declares a new variable (or redeclares an existing one if mixed with a new variable).
        
*   **Scope**:
    
    *   \=: Can be used both inside and outside functions.
        
    *   :=: Only used inside functions.

In the example, a is first declared using var and then assigned values using =. b is declared and initialized using :=. Later, both a and b are reassigned using =. Finally, a mixed declaration and reassignment is shown where a is reassigned and c is declared and assigned using :=.
